Doxygen has some issues with outputting C.
To fix this, some configuration is needed in doxywizzard.

Step by step configuration to get a viable output 
(some more configuration can be done for sure, but this is the bare minimum).

1. Wizard.
-   We can mark the scan recursively function if we want to get everything from a folder. 
    For example a project with 3 folders and each has .C files.

2. Expert
-   Go to Project -> Mark Optimize_Output_For_C
-   Go to Build -> Mark Extract_all
-   Source Browser -> Mark Source_Browser, Inline_Sources, Strip_Code_Comments,
    References_Link_Source, Source_Tooltips, Verbatim_Headers.
